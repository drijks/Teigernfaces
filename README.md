# Teigernfaces
My Teigernface program in python

This program was developed for my senior seminar in mathematics and my capstone in computer science at Western Colorado University (formerly Western Colorado State University). It uses linear algebra, specifically SVD and eigenfaces, to determine key features in images of tiger faces and help identify the tiger in a given photograph.

This program uses the PIL, numpy, and matplotlib python libraries. Instructions on how to run the program can be found in the file howtouseit.txt

The faces used in this program belong to the big cats of the Center for Animal Research and Education in Bridgeport, TX, and the photographs were taken by Derek Krahn, also known as BigCatDerek, who has been very supportive of this project.
